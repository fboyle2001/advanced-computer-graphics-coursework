Plan
Dynamic Performance Optimisation / Visual Quality Control
- Target framerate
- Anti-aliasing
- Animation detail
- Level of detail
- Tracking FPS and render loop time -> Average Meter
- Dropdown selection

Parametric surfaces and curves
- Trampoline with parametric deformation
- Use a skeletal model to jump?

Progressive Mesh
- Buffer Geometry
- Simulated network streaming
- Combine with level of detail?
- Create LoD dynamically?

Level of Detail
- Make basic model with a couple of level of details

Animation
- Parametric surfaces for trees
- Human characters e.g. running or something? Skeletal Animation
- Gates
- Maybe a trampoline

- Lighting
- Selective Refinement
- gltf compression

Look back over demonstrations
Combining techniques is important
